GROUP BY Clause:

The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
It is often accompanied by aggregate functions (such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) to perform calculations on each group of rows.

ROLLUP Clause:

The ROLLUP extension of GROUP BY generates subtotals and grand totals for specified columns, creating a hierarchy of grouping levels.

CUBE Clause:

The CUBE extension of GROUP BY is similar to ROLLUP but provides subtotals and grand totals for all possible combinations of the specifiedÂ columns.
